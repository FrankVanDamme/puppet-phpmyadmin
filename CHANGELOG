pull requests directly to the github project!

Bugfixes: 
- Properly support direct installation of module without needing to define
apache or php configuration on node.
- Lots of lint fixes and param-level cleanup
- Re-factorization of codebase to resolve issues with missing variables and
similar made over many conflicting pull requests. Will be more careful with
